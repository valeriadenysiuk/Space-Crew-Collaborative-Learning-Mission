Thank you for your interest in contributing! This is a personal frontend project, and currently, I am the only contributor.  

However, here are some guidelines in case you want to collaborate or refer to them in the future:

## Code Style
- Use consistent formatting and indentation (2 spaces recommended).
- Write clear, readable code with meaningful variable and function names.
- Comment your code when necessary to explain complex logic.

## File Structure
- Keep HTML, CSS, and JavaScript separate for clarity.
- Place assets (images, fonts, icons) in the `assets/` folder.
- Follow the existing project structure when adding new files.

## Commits
- Use clear and concise commit messages.
- Use the present tense and describe the change, e.g., `Add responsive navbar`.

## Issues & Suggestions
- Feel free to open issues for bugs or feature ideas.
- Describe the issue clearly, including steps to reproduce and screenshots if possible.

## Pull Requests
- Always make sure your branch is up-to-date with the main branch.
- Test your code before creating a pull request.
- Provide a brief description of the changes in your PR.
