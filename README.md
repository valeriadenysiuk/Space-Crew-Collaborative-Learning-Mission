##  Project Overview

Welcome to **Space Crew Collaborative Learning Mission**, an interactive web application inspired by **game theory**. This project simulates a team of astronauts who must collaboratively decide whether to study each day. Their choices directly influence the success of their mission, displayed in real-time through a rocket fuel percentage at the center of the screen.

The game provides a fun and educational experience, blending strategy, teamwork, and decision-making.  

**Key features:**  
- Central rocket displaying **fuel percentage** based on team decisions.  
- Daily astronaut choices affecting mission outcome.  
- Timer above the rocket to track daily progress.  
- Individual **astronaut profiles** with detailed statistics.  
- Panel to **add new astronauts** under oath, expanding your crew.  
- Interactive mini-game format to demonstrate **game theory principles**.

This project is designed for educational purposes, showing how individual decisions in a group setting can impact collective success.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to:  
1. Teach **game theory concepts** in an engaging and interactive way.  
2. Provide a visual and intuitive interface for team decision-making dynamics.  
3. Encourage collaborative thinking and daily strategy planning.  
4. Create a foundation for future multiplayer expansions.

## How to Use

1. Open the application in a web browser.  
2. Observe the **central rocket** and current fuel level.  
3. Each astronaut must choose **whether to study** each day.  
4. Watch how individual choices affect the **mission outcome**.  
5. Access each astronaut's **profile** to track progress.  
6. Use the **Add Astronaut** panel to expand your crew.  
7. Repeat daily to see cumulative effects and learn game theory strategies.

##  Future Improvements

- **Multiplayer mode**: Friends from around the world can join the same mission room.  
- **User accounts**: Save progress, add friends, and share results.  
- **Daily notifications**: Remind astronauts to make their choices.  
- **Enhanced statistics**: Visual charts to track learning efficiency.  
- **Mobile optimization**: Fully responsive design for tablets and phones.
